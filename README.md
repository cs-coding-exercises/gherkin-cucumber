# gherkin-cucumber
Learning Gherkin and Cucumber using Ruby Webdriver.

This is a basic set of tests against cars.com to familiarize myself with Gherkin/Cucumber.

it involves the following:
  - a feature file
  - a corresponding Ruby steps file
  - leveragable resource files (eventually)
  
Current Files:
  - ~/cucumber/features/asmd.feature
  - ~/cucumber/features/step_definitions/asmd.rb
